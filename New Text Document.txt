<p>I was born in South Korea, Seoul on 23rd November 2001. I moved to Australia when I was 5
and have been living in Adelaide since. I graduated from Concordia college in 2019 and studied bachelor of 
pharmacy at UniSA until 2022. I can speak Korean and use it mainly to my parents. One interesting thing about me is
that I use to make music and use to love making music but saw no talent in myself unfortunately.</p>
