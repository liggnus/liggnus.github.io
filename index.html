<h3>Name: Sunggil Kang</h3>

<h1>Background Info:</h1>

<p>I was born in South Korea, Seoul on 23rd November 2001. I moved to Australia when I was 5
and have been living in Adelaide since. I graduated from Concordia college in 2019 and studied bachelor of 
pharmacy at UniSA until 2022. I can speak Korean and use it mainly to my parents. One interesting thing about me is
that I use to make music and use to love making music but saw no talent in myself unfortunately.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h3>
<p>My interest in IT began as early as I could remember. It was my first time playing a web browser games on my dad's
laptop on a korean news site. I had hours and hours of endless fun exploring different game types and would
wonder how I could keep myself entertained for so long. My main interest in IT is mainly games but branched 
towards helping others. I remember I use to be the kid teachers and fellow peers came to me to fix IT issues
whether that was the video not playing, audio not working, etc. I do not have any formal IT experience but the
experiences with IT I have encountered were enough for me to love IT.</p>
<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>Honestly, I wanted to get into University of Adelaide bachelor of computer science right of the bat. However,
I have more than two years studied at a tertiary level and my GPA was not good due to a couple failed subjects
in the dreaded bachelor of pharmacy. My only option was to either do more pharmacy so my GPA was good enough to
transfer, or study at open universities and pass subjects to be able to get into bachelor of computer science.
That is what lead me to RMIT as I was free to choose any two courses and decided to have a taste of IT.</p>
<h3>What did you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p>I expect to learn the fundamentals and basics of IT. I honestly thought there would be more coding in this course
but I enjoy learning about the social and team working aspect of IT. I am finding it very useful and can relate
to why it is a fundamental part of IT and working in an IT department.</p>
<h1>Ideal Job:</h1>
<p><a href="https://au.indeed.com/Computer-Science-jobs-in-Adelaide-Region-SA?vjk=67c135a57
e507914&advn=3874725097895225">Job Link</a></p>
<p>This job position is for a graduate software developer. The main tasks for software developers are; developing
and testing of software systems, and team working with RDA staff and client. This job will be in the field of
machine learning, deep learning and imagery analysis. The idea of developing software systems in the field of
machine learning stood out to me and made this position appealing for me as I love the technical aspect of
working in IT. I also find interest in machine learning as I have been an avid chess player in the past.</p>
<p>The skills and qualifications required for this job are; meeting Australian Department of Defence security
clearance, understand secure software development lifecycle, having experience coding with Python, C++, Java,
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, or PHP, experience with object oriented design methodologies, and experience with SQL.
I currently have the tiniest experience in HTML, CSS, C++ and Python. I also mostly have hospitality and retail
experience which would help with the team working factor.</p>
<p>I would be able to build the skills, qualifications and experience through university and possibly some self
study after graduation if needed. The computer science course covers object oriented programming and with 
the programming languages, once one language is learnt the others can be learnt with relative ease as they all
follow a similar pattern.</p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBLue;">MBTI - ENTP-A/ENTP-T</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBLue;">Learning style - Auditory 40%, visual 35%, Tactile 25%</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBLue;">The big 5 - Openness 92%, Conscientiousness 23%, Extraversion 83%, Agreeableness 60%, Neuroticism 50%</p>
<p>The MBTI test was very interesting as I could relate to it alot. Suprisingly it knew my strength and weaknesses
and what I was like in my social life. However, most of the things I already knew about myself and were not
new discoveries I realised of myself. The learning styles one I disagree with as I would not indentify as an
auditory learner. I would consider myself more visual and tactile but as the results display I do learn via
various ways. The big five was one I also could relate to quite a bit although I think I have more conscientiousness
than the resulted conscientiousness.</p>
<p>These results would not really influence my behaviour in a team as I would not change my personality after doing a
test. I would subconsciouly get into an approach where I am thinking outside the box and think of ways to complete
the task in another easier way. As I enjoy debating, I would be debating on various things from allocating tasks
to different people with differing strength to if the information is correct with given elements of the tasks.
I would take leadership if need be or sit back and analyse things before debating with other team members.</p>
<p>Taking all of this informtion into account, when forming a team I would try to guide my team members to the correct
and interesting paths to complete the task at hand. The team would benefit from my critical thinking and the 
challenges I would make to their ideas further improving the quality of our work. However, this may come off as
disapproving, uptight and not agreeable so I would need to find ways of challenging and debating with my team
members in a way that is not disapproving but in an encouraging "let's make this better" mindset. I would be best
fit to be in a leadership role or a secondary leadership role.</p>

<h1>Project Idea:</h1>
<p>The project I have chosen is developing a hardcore co-op game. It will be a role-playing game where the player is
free to explore, craft, and build whilst completing a mainline mission. The name of the game will be Newheim. 
It will allow character customization with compulsory co-op elements which will force players to work together as
a team against the hostile environment. The players will need to fend off monsters, wildlife, nature, and necessities
such as hunger and thirst. There will also be puzzles, parkour and mazes which will test different skillsets players
might have in their team.</p>
<p>This project will be useful because from personal experience, co-op games have entertained and strengthened the bonds
between my friends and me. It gave us something to do and brought us together as a family. It also gives a reason to
hang out together online and make lasting memories with each other. As of recent, with the coronavirus lockdowns,
teens were locked away and mental health was becoming an issue due to loneliness and boredom. Imagine a fantasy world
where you are forced to work together as a team to beat the game, this would resolve the problems of lockdowns.</p>
<p>The game will be in 3d with the likes of Valheim and Minecraft elements. The basic structure for the story of the game
will be that an evil demon lord is corrupting a once peaceful world, slowly corrupting the environment and mobs into
hostility, making them attack everything in its vicinity. Before the world is consumed by corruption, players will
need to fight through corrupted areas, reaching the final boss and finally ending their reign of corruption. The game 
will start off as most co-op games do, players will spawn in a random spot on a pre-generated map. Before they spawn, 
they will be allowed to customize their character so they look like themselves or let their imagination and creativity 
take over. The players will spawn in different areas of the map forcing them to fend for themselves for the first 
few nights. They will be required to communicate using discord to inform each other of different landmarks they have
found as they will have no maps to guide them to where they are on the map. Being a hardcore game, the main part of
the game will be to survive and the hardcore part of the game will be that if everyone on the team gets wiped, the
world will be deleted forcing players to lose all their progress and restart. This will be countered by the ability
to revive your team members. There will also be a time element where the corruption will spread over time making the
game harder and harder as the world will become more hostile. Players will need to first chop trees and mine stones
to make basic tools, make a shelter to store extra resources, and make armor and weapons to fight the demon lord's
armies that wander around. They will have to make their way deeper toward the demon lord's land where the mobs get
stronger the further you go toward his land. Along the way, there will be puzzles to complete such as a maze to begin.
There will also be riddles to solve to unlock ancient ruins that players may explore to find better crafting resources.
There will also be mini bosses that players will need to kill in order to unlock entrance to the final boss. The bosses
will be programmed in a way that the contribution of all the players are required in one way or another. Even after 
killing the final boss, the demon lord, players may continue to keep playing to de-corrupt the world. There will also
be options for different difficulties to allow replayability. Collectibles will be added for full 100% completion of
the game if players enjoyed full exploration and completion of games. The overall objective of the game is to make the
players work together, learn to co-operate, build leadership skills, but mostly have fun with eachother in completing
this game as a challenge.</p>
<p>There are few softwares that allow easy 3D game making with cryengine, godot, buildbox, and unity being a few to
mention. The hardware required would either be a PC or laptop; something that can run the game development softwares.
Unity would be the best to use as it is versatile, free, and there are plenty of tutorials and information online that
will allow easier development of the game. Unity also has a very beginner friendly interface that does not limit the
developer from more sophisticated tools. Lastly, game testers will be required as it is going to be a co-op game rather
than a single player game.</p>
<p>The skills required would be to know how to navigate the Unity software. WIth Unity, although there is some coding
regarding to mob behaviours, modeling characters, mobs, and the environment will also stand to be another skill
requirement. As for hardware, I have access to a high-end PC and laptop that can run Unity. I also have a few 
friends that can act as my game testers and they would be great target audiences as they have played similar genre 
of games. Learning the skillset to use Unity would be decently feasible with all the tutorials online.</p>
<p>If the project is successful, it could possibly become the next Minecraft, Valheim, Terraria, Vermintide 2, the 
possibility is endless. It could become a timeless classic like the other great co-op games. The original problem 
will be solved by giving players another great game to enjoy and be a time sink. The impact could be limitless as 
evidence given by games such as minecraft that gave so many opportunities to so many people. Some of the biggest 
youtubers today would not have surfaced and helped entertain so many more people if it were not for Minecraft.</p>
